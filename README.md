# Meltdown
⚠☢Meltdown is not intended for actual use☢⚠ Console program that makes AES encrypted zip files.

I made a console program that makes AES encrypted zip files. It's not meant to be used for data you'd actually want to protect tho. It was just to get to know C# better. But feel free to mess around with it !
It has obvious references to the VOCALOID song "Meltdown" performed by Kagamine Rin (https://vocaloid.fandom.com/wiki/%E7%82%89%E5%BF%83%E8%9E%8D%E8%A7%A3_(Roshin_Yuukai))

The code itself has several JoJo's Bizarre Adventure refs.
